                            <p style="font-weight:500;">It all started when I was 11 years old and inherited my moms old computer, beginning my journey of computer games and watching silly videoes online.
                                Eventually I started looking into design, and stumbled upon creating my first website, using exclusively HTML & CSS. It was bright, colourful, and looked awful - the way every first website should.
                                Ever since, my curiosity for designing and programming things has only grown. Fast-forward to today, and I am studying a Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science, with the intention of becoming a full-stack developer.

                                When I'm not programming, I'm usually reading, hiking or skiing with my dog, or playing super-old Nintendo games. I'm currently obsessed with Zelda games from before the 2000s.

                                I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science, with a main focus on programming, from OsloMet University.
                                This comprehensive three-year programme has equipped me with a broad understanding of programming and IT development. I have gained valuable experience in both front-end and back-end programming, software development, algorithms, and more.

                                <p>HabbGames was a fun little website I created when I was 15 years old, it was the first ever "full-stack" program I made - without knowing what that meant at the time. The application consisted of a user-system with login/logout functionality, had a forum page, article-pages, and many more functions. It was used as a Habbo-co-page - Habbo is/was a popular online RPG-game.
                                I don't have a lot of code or anything from the time of creating the website, but I have a few pictures and lots of memories. I decided to include this as a project of mine, as it is my first ever working application - I'm both proud and embarrassed when talking about HabbGames.<br>Oh, and it was created using HTML, CSS, JS, and lots of PHP, alongside a functional database.</p>
